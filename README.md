# OntoGPT

I will elaborate this in very near future, but here is just a very quick way to launch `babyLLM` training.  

- Setup
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/B-Gendron/OntoGPT.git
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
- Launch data download if needed, then model training
```bash
cd babyLLM
python3 main.py
```
