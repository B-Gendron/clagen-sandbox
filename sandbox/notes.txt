Ideas for finetuning

[x] OPTION 1: check the readability class of the output. To do so, write an auxiliary function that:
    - generates a sentence with a readability level instruction given in prompt
    - add this infividual to a temp rdf file for the batch
    - perform inference on this file (like it is done in create_individuals.py)
    - uses the mapping class -> class index to finally output the individual class

[x] OPTION 2: change the prompt to finish on last utterance by (ReadabilityLevel= which encourages the model to learn the concept of readability (in a final test step we can use OPTION 1 to check of the model actually learnt something). We need a function that:
    - decodes the output
    - parses it to deduce the predicted readability level
    - maps it to the class index, and that's all :)
